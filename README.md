Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a master's student in Data Science at UC San Diego (UCSD).
ðŸŒ± I'm a self-taught programmer with a strong passion for machine learning and statistics.
ðŸ‘€ My research interests focus on applying machine learning and statistical methods to solve real-world problems, including predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making.
âš¡ Fun fact: I love to paint and read books, often drawing inspiration from creative processes to fuel my technical work.
ðŸ’¼ Currently, Iâ€™m working on projects related to causal discovery in finance, and statistical modeling to improve predictive accuracy and model transparency.
ðŸ“š Iâ€™m focused on advancing my understanding of machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, and how these tools can be used to extract insights from complex datasets.
